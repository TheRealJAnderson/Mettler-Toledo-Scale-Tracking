# Mettler-Toledo-Scale-Tracking
This repository contains my project to create a DIY Mettler Toledo lab balance mass flow rate tracker. One can load this onto a laptop or Raspberry Pi, connect an RS-232 cable to the balance, run the program, and see the current flow rate of anything onto or off of the scale.
